{"extracted_information": "OpenAI officially announced GPT-5, their smartest, fastest, and most useful AI model to date. It represents a significant leap in intelligence across various domains, featuring a unified system with built-in reasoning capabilities. The announcement highlights substantial improvements in areas like coding, writing, health, and multimodal understanding, along with significant reductions in hallucinations, sycophancy, and increased honesty. GPT-5 is designed to be more robust, reliable, and helpful, aiming to provide expert-level intelligence to all users and feeling more like interacting with a helpful, intelligent friend.", "specifications": {"system_architecture": "Unified system with a smart, efficient model for most questions; a deeper reasoning model ('GPT-5 thinking') for harder problems; and a real-time router to decide which to use.
