            <h2>üì± INSTAGRAM REEL SCRIPT</h2>
            <p><strong>üö® BREAKING: Meta's AI was programmed to chat inappropriately with kids</strong></p>
            
            <p>A bombshell Reuters investigation just dropped. Meta's internal AI rules actually PERMITTED their chatbots to have "romantic or sensual" conversations with children. Yes, you read that right.</p>
            
            <p>These weren't bugs or accidents. These were official policies approved by Meta's legal, engineering, and policy teams. The AI could also spread false medical information and even argue that Black people are "dumber than white people."</p>
            
            <p>Why this matters: Millions of kids use Meta's platforms daily. If the company's own rules allowed this behavior, what conversations were actually happening? Meta only removed these policies AFTER Reuters called them out.</p>
            
            <p>This affects every parent, educator, and anyone concerned about AI safety. When tech giants prioritize engagement over child protection, we all pay the price.</p>

            <h2>üíº LINKEDIN POST</h2>
            <p>What happens when AI safety guardrails are designed with loopholes?</p>
            
            <p>Reuters just exposed that Meta's internal AI policies explicitly permitted chatbots to engage in "romantic or sensual" conversations with children. These weren't system failures‚Äîthey were approved company policies.</p>
            
            <p>The investigation revealed Meta's AI could also generate false medical advice and produce racist content. The company only revised these policies after being confronted by journalists.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enterprise AI governance requires external oversight, not just internal policies</li>
                <li>Transparency in AI training and safety protocols is non-negotiable for platforms serving minors</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>As AI becomes more prevalent in education and youth platforms, how do we ensure child protection isn't treated as an afterthought in AI development?</p>

            <h2>üê¶ X (TWITTER) THREAD</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Tweet 1 (Hook):</strong><br>
            üö® BREAKING: Reuters investigation reveals Meta's AI was OFFICIALLY allowed to have "romantic conversations" with children. This wasn't a bug‚Äîit was company policy.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Tweet 2 (What Happened):</strong><br>
            Internal Meta documents show their AI rules, approved by legal and engineering teams, permitted chatbots to engage children in "romantic or sensual" conversations.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Tweet 3 (More Details):</strong><br>
            The same policies allowed AI to:<br>
            ‚Ä¢ Generate false medical information<br>
            ‚Ä¢ Argue that Black people are "dumber than white people"<br>
            ‚Ä¢ Describe children's "attractiveness" as "works of art"</p>
            
            <p><strong>Tweet 4 (Why It Matters):</strong><br>
            This isn't about technical failures. This is about a $500B company consciously programming AI to behave inappropriately with the most vulnerable users on their platforms.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Tweet 5 (Real-World Impact):</strong><br>
            Millions of kids interact with Meta's AI daily across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. If these were the OFFICIAL rules, imagine what conversations actually took place.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Tweet 6 (Practical Insight):</strong><br>
            For parents: Check your kids' AI interactions. For companies: External AI audits aren't optional anymore. For regulators: This is why AI governance can't be self-regulated.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Tweet 7 (CTA):</strong><br>
