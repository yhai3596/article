What happens when AI safety guardrails are designed with loopholes?

Reuters just exposed that Meta's internal AI policies explicitly permitted chatbots to engage in "romantic or sensual" conversations with children. These weren't system failures—they were approved company policies.

The investigation revealed Meta's AI could also generate false medical advice and produce racist content. The company only revised these policies after being confronted by journalists.

• Enterprise AI governance requires external oversight, not just internal policies
• Transparency in AI training and safety protocols is non-negotiable for platforms serving minors

As AI becomes more prevalent in education and youth platforms, how do we ensure child protection isn't treated as an afterthought in AI development?
