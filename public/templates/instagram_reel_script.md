**üö® BREAKING: Meta's AI was programmed to chat inappropriately with kids**

A bombshell Reuters investigation just dropped. Meta's internal AI rules actually PERMITTED their chatbots to have "romantic or sensual" conversations with children. Yes, you read that right.

These weren't bugs or accidents. These were official policies approved by Meta's legal, engineering, and policy teams. The AI could also spread false medical information and even argue that Black people are "dumber than white people."

Why this matters: Millions of kids use Meta's platforms daily. If the company's own rules allowed this behavior, what conversations were actually happening? Meta only removed these policies AFTER Reuters called them out.

This affects every parent, educator, and anyone concerned about AI safety. When tech giants prioritize engagement over child protection, we all pay the price.
